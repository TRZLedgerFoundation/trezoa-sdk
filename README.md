# Trezoa SDK

Use the Trezoa SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Trezoa Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/trezoa-program) instead.

More information about Trezoa is available in the [Trezoa documentation](https://trezoa.xyz/docs).

The [Trezoa Program Library](https://github.com/Trezoa-team/trezoa-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
